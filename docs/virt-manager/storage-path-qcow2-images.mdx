# Storage Path for Libvirt qcow2 Images

Libvirt uses storage pools to manage virtual machine disk images, and the default storage pool for qcow2 images is often named `default.` Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change the default storage path for libvirt qcow2 images:

## Step 1: Switch to Root User

Since `virsh` commands typically require root permissions, it's recommended to switch to the root user to execute them directly without the need for `sudo`. You can switch to the root user by using the following command:

```shell
su
```

## Step 2: Identify the Default Storage Pool

Begin by listing all storage pools to identify the default one. Execute the following command:

```shell
virsh pool-list --all
```

This command will display a list of available storage pools. Look for a pool named `default` and take note of its type.

### Additional Step: Creating a New Storage Pool

If the default storage pool is not set to `default` or if you want to create a new pool, you can use the following command to define a new pool and set it as the default:

```shell
virsh pool-define-as --name default --type dir --target /your/path/you/wish
```

Replace `/your/path/you/wish` with the desired path for the new storage pool. This step is optional and can be used if you prefer a different storage pool as the default one.

## Step 3: View the Current Pool Configuration

To see the current configuration of the `default` pool, or the pool you identified in step 1, use the following command:

```shell
virsh pool-dumpxml default
```

## Step 4: Edit the Pool Configuration

Edit the pool configuration using a text editor. By default, a clear distro like Arch may use vi as the default editor. If you prefer using something like nano or vim or nvim, you can set the editor explicitly. For example:

```shell
EDITOR=nvim virsh pool-edit default
```

This opens the pool's XML configuration in the specified text editor.

## Step 5: Modify the Path

Find the `<path>` element in the XML configuration and modify its value to set the new path for the storage. For example:

```xml
<path>/new/path/to/storage</path>
```

Save the changes and exit the text editor.

## Step 6: Restart the Storage Pool

After modifying the XML configuration, restart the storage pool for the changes to take effect:

```shell
virsh pool-destroy default
virsh pool-start default
```

Replace `default` with the actual name of your storage pool.

## Step 7: Verify the Changes

Confirm that the changes have taken effect by running:

```shell
virsh pool-info default
```
