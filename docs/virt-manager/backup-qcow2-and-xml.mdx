# Backup and Restoration QCOW2 and XML Configuration

This guide will walk you through the process of backing up and restoring your virt-manager virtual machines, virsh provides a simple way to backup and restore virtual machines. This is useful for safeguarding your virtual machines against unexpected issues and ensuring that you can recover them quickly when needed.

## Backup XML Configuration

1. Locate the XML configuration files of your virtual machines. These files contain all the essential configuration details.

   ```shell
   /etc/libvirt/qemu/
   ```

2. Identify the name of the virtual machine you want to back up. You can use the following command to list all available virtual machines:

   ```shell
   sudo virsh list --all
   ```

3. Dump the XML configuration of your chosen virtual machine into a new XML file:

   ```shell
   sudo virsh dumpxml vm_name > vm_name.xml
   ```

   Replace `vm_name` with the actual name of your virtual machine.

## Backup qcow2 Disk Image

1. Locate the qcow2 disk image files of your virtual machines. These files contain the actual system files.

   ```shell
   /var/lib/libvirt/images/
   ```

2. Copy the qcow2 disk image file of your chosen virtual machine to your backup location:

   ```shell
   sudo cp /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm_name.qcow2 backup_location/
   ```

   Replace `vm_name` with the name of your virtual machine and `backup_location` with the desired backup directory.

## Restore Backup

1. Move the backed-up qcow2 disk image file to the original directory:

   ```shell
   sudo mv backup_location/vm_name.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/
   ```

2. Move the backed-up XML configuration file to the original directory:

   ```shell
   sudo mv backup_location/vm_name.xml /etc/libvirt/qemu/
   ```

3. Define the virtual machine using the restored XML configuration file, This will register the virtual machine with libvirt, making it available on virt-manager, and then start the virt-manager application will show the restored virtual machine.

   ```shell
   sudo virsh define --file /etc/libvirt/qemu/vm_name.xml
   ```
