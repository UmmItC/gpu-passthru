# Installing require Packages

Alright, let's installing the essential packages. Each of these plays a key role in getting virtualization up and running smoothly.

We'll be using `virt-manager`, which provides a user-friendly interface for managing virtual machines. `qemu` is a robust emulator that handles hardware virtualization.

Here’s a breakdown of the packages you’ll need:

- **virt-manager:** A desktop user interface for managing virtual machines.
- **qemu-base:** A basic QEMU setup for headless environments.
- **vde2:** Virtual Distributed Ethernet for emulators like QEMU.
- **iptables-nft:** A Linux kernel packet control tool, using the nft interface.
- **nftables:** Userspace tools for Netfilter tables.
- **dnsmasq:** A lightweight, easy-to-configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
- **bridge-utils:** Utilities for configuring the Linux Ethernet bridge.
- **edk2-ovmf:** Firmware for Virtual Machines (x86_64, i686).
- **dmidecode:** Utilities for Desktop Management Interface tables.

To install these packages, run the following command in your terminal:
```shell
sudo pacman -S virt-manager qemu-base vde2 iptables-nft nftables dnsmasq bridge-utils edk2-ovmf dmidecode
```

### Qemu Packages Required

I’ve noticed that the `qemu` package names have changed over time. Previously, installing `qemu` was straightforward, but now it’s split into several packages. Although the names have changed, the package manager should automatically handle these updates for you.

To ensure already cover all the requirements, you should also install the following packages:

```shell
sudo pacman -S qemu-hw-display-qxl qemu-hw-display-virtio-vga qemu-hw-usb-redirect qemu-audio-spice qemu-hw-usb-host qemu-chardev-spice
```

These packages provide support for display QXL, VGA, USB redirection, audio spice and spicevmc. Without these, you might encounter errors or find that some functions don’t work properly.

## Next Steps: Configuring Libvirt Permissions

Next, we’ll cover how to configure libvirt permissions to ensure that `virt-manager` and `libvirt` don’t run into any permission issues and work smoothly.
