# Optional Devices

As mentioned before, mouse, keyboard and monitors aren't the important part for the GPU-Passthrough. Just pick ones you like for yourself.

:::tip
While not critical for the passthrough functionality itself, having dedicated peripherals for each system (host and VM) will provide the best user experience.

Choose the mouse, keyboard, and monitors that best suit your preferences.
