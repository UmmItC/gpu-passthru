# How to Buy a GPU

Choosing a GPU is straightforward, but there are a few considerations based on your needs.

In general, just pick the GPU you want. 

## GPU Recommendations by OS

From a GNU/Linux perspective, AMD GPUs are recommended, while Nvidia GPUs are better suited for Windows.

For optimal setup:
- **AMD Radeon RX 7000 Series** for the GNU/Linux host
- **RTX 4000 Series** for the Windows guest

If you prefer using a GNU/Linux guest, it's best to use two AMD GPUs.

:::caution[Avoid Nvidia for Linux]
Don't even think about using an Nvidia GPU for GNU/Linux, this would be the worst choice you could make.

Linus Torvalds: Fuck you Nvidia. This sentence still works in 2025, even though it comes from more than 10 years ago.
