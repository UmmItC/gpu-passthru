# Setting Up Your Virtual Machine (Windows 11) â€“ The Final Steps

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up a Windows 11 virtual machine on QEMU/KVM. It includes installing necessary packages, configuring the virtual machine, and handling installation steps.

## 1. Installing Required Packages

Windows 11 has a requirement for TPM (Trusted Platform Module). To address this, you need to install the required packages.

Install the `swtpm` package to provide a virtual TPM:

```shell
sudo pacman -S swtpm
```

## 2. Creating a New VM

### 2.1 Opening virt-manager

Open virt-manager on your system and click on `New Virtual Machine` to start the creation process.

### 2.2 Selecting Installation Media

In the installation method selection screen, choose `Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)`.

![Local install media](./images/win11/1.xofx/1of5.png)

### 2.3 Locating the Windows 11 ISO

Click `Browse` to locate your Windows 11 ISO file and select it from your file system.

![Windows ISO](./images/win11/1.xofx/2of5.png)

### 2.4 Configuring Memory and CPU

Set the amount of memory (RAM) and number of CPU cores according to your requirements.

![Memory and CPU](./images/win11/1.xofx/3of5.png)

### 2.5 Setting Up Storage

Configure your storage settings by allocating a virtual hard disk size appropriate for Windows 11.

![Enable Storage](./images/win11/1.xofx/4of5.png)

### 2.6 Naming the VM

Provide a name for your virtual machine and select `Customize configuration before install` to access advanced settings.

![Customize Configuration](./images/win11/1.xofx/5of5.png)

## 3. Virt-manager Configuration

### 3.1 Configuring Firmware

In the Overview section, set the `Firmware` to `UEFI x86_64: /usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd`. 

This is crucial as secure boot is required for Windows 11. 

:::caution
**IMPORTANT!** Ensure you are using the correct firmware as the changes cannot be undone after selecting `Begin installation`. If necessary, you will need to recreate the VM.
:::

![Firmware](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/Firmware.png)

### 3.2 Setting Up CPUs

Configure the CPU settings by setting the CPU mode to `host-passthrough`. Enable the option `Copy host CPU configuration (host-passthrough)` and manually set the CPU topology according to your requirements.

![CPU](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/CPU%20Select.png)

### 3.3 Adding VirtIO Disk

Add a `VirtIO` storage device with a size of `40GB`. Configure this device with the `VirtIO` bus type and set the device type to `Disk device`.

![Add VirtIO Disk](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/VirtIO%20Disk.png)

### 3.4 Adding VirtIO ISO

Create a `VirtIO ISO` storage device and set it as a CDROM device. This will be used for installing VirtIO drivers during the Windows setup.

![Add VirtIO ISO](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/VirtIO%20iso.png)

### 3.5 Configuring Boot Options

Set the `SATA CDROM 1` as the primary boot device to ensure the VM boots from the Windows 11 ISO.

### 3.6 Adding TPM Device

Add a TPM device and configure it to version `2.0`. This is required for Windows 11 installation.

![TPM](./images/win11/2.virt-manager%20device%20setup/tls-tpm.png)

### 3.7 Removing NIC

Remove the network interface card (NIC) to avoid the Microsoft Account sign-in requirements during the Windows installation. You can reconnect the NIC after the installation. 

:::tip
Removing the NIC ensures that the installation does not require online activation, which can be bypassed by using command-line tools to enable offline mode.
:::

## 4. Booting the VM and Installing Windows 11

## 5. Post-Installation Configuration

Now just install the window in the normal way. Don't worry too much about it being different.

### 5.1 Power Off the System

After completing the Windows 11 installation, you should power off the VM. This is done by using the `Power off` option from the VM's menu.

![Win11 Power Off](./images/win11/6.%20installed/poweroff.png)

### 5.2 Adding GPU and GPU-Audio Devices

#### 5.2.1 Adding the GPU

Add your GPU to the VM configuration. This involves specifying the GPU as a passthrough device in the VM settings.

![Win11 Add GPU](./images/win11/8.%20Add%20GPU/w11-add-gpu.png)

#### 5.2.2 Adding GPU-Audio

Similarly, add your GPU-Audio device. This step ensures that audio functionalities from the GPU are also included in the VM setup.

For Windows 11, you need to manually enable the GPU to utilize it for your VM.

#### 7.1.1 Accessing Device Manager

Back to the `Device Manager` on your Windows 11 VM.

#### 7.1.2 Enabling the GPU

Locate your GPU under the `Display adapters` section, right-click it, and select `Enable` to activate the GPU.

![Enable GPU](./images/win11/amd-driver/enable-amd-driver.png)

### 7.2 Installing GPU Drivers

To ensure your GPU functions correctly, you need to install the appropriate drivers, since it's Windows LOL.

Visit your GPU manufacturer's website (AMD, Nvidia, or Intel) to download the latest drivers for your GPU.

## You're All Set!

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Windows 11 on a QEMU/KVM virtual machine, including configuring a virtual TPM and GPU :)
