# Configuring Libvirt

Now that we've got the packages installed, you might notice that when you try to open `virt-manager`, it asks for the root password. To smooth things out, we'll need to configuring libvirt, qemu, and virt-manager for adjust permissions so everything runs more seamlessly.

## Adjust Permissions for `virt-manager`

Here’s how to set up your system so you can use `virt-manager` without constantly needing root access:

1. Open the configuration file with:
   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf
   ```

2. Look for the `unix_sock_group` and `unix_sock_rw_perms` entries in the file. Uncomment these lines and set the values as shown below:

   - Set `unix_sock_group` to `libvirt`:
     ```plaintext
     unix_sock_group = "libvirt"
     ```

   - Set `unix_sock_rw_perms` to `0770` to allow the right permissions for `virt-manager`:
     ```plaintext
     unix_sock_rw_perms = "0770"
     ```

3. Save and exit by typing `:wq`.

This configuration will let you launch and manage `virt-manager` without running into permission problems.

### Set Up Logging for Troubleshooting (Optional but Recommended)

If you run into issues with `virt-manager`, having logs can be a lifesaver. To set up logging:

1. Open the `/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf` file again:
   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf
   ```

2. Add these lines at the end of the file to set up logging:
   ```plaintext
   log_filters="3:qemu 1:libvirt"
   log_outputs="2:file:/var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log"
   ```

This way, you’ll have detailed logs to help troubleshoot any problems.

## Add Your User to the `libvirt` Group

To use `virt-manager` without any superuser warnings, add your user to the `libvirt` and `kvm` groups:

1. Run the following command:
   ```shell
   sudo usermod -a -G kvm,libvirt $(whoami)
   ```

## Enable and Start Libvirt Services

Make sure libvirt services start automatically on boot and then start the libvirt service:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
```

### Verify Group Membership

Check that your user has been added to the necessary groups:

```shell
sudo groups $(whoami)
```

This confirms that you’ve successfully added your user to the `libvirt` and `kvm` groups.

## QEMU Configuration

To make sure QEMU processes run with your user permissions:

1. Edit the `qemu.conf` file:
   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
   ```

   > Tip: In `vim`, you can quickly find `user =` by pressing `/`, typing `user =`, and pressing `Enter`.

2. Look for these lines:

   ```plaintext
   user = "libvirt"
   group = "libvirt"
   ```

3. Change `"libvirt"` to your username:

   ```plaintext
   user = "username"
   group = "username"
   ```

This adjustment ensures QEMU processes run with your user privileges.

## Restart the `libvirtd` Service

Apply your changes by restarting the `libvirtd` service:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

### Start `virsh` Network Automatically - (Optional but Recommended)

If you only want to passthrough your LAN or wireless, ignore it's ok.

Every standard libvirt installation provides NAT based connectivity to virtual machines out of the box. This is the so called `default virtual network`.

```shell
sudo virsh net-autostart default
```

Now, you’ve configured permissions, added your user to the right groups, QEMU settings, and ensured services are running correctly.
